## **Overview**

This repository consolidates bioinformatics analysis pipelines for a multi-omics study integrating **subcellular RNA sequencing**, **mutant mRNA sequencing**, **polysome profiling**, **TMT-based proteomics**, and **cross-omics data integration**.
Each module is designed for reproducibility and includes detailed documentation. For specific workflows, navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and refer to its `README.md`.
